      <h2>CSS Fonts: </h2>
      <h4>In css thre are two types of font family. </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>generic family - a group of font families with a similar look (like "Serif" or "Monospace")</li>
        <li>font family - a specific font family (like "Times New Roman" or "Arial")</li>
      </ol>

        This paragraph is an example of font-family as serif. Note: We can also use more than one font by seprating comma eg- "font-family: Times, serif;."<br>
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold">This is an example of bold font-weight.</p>
      <div class="font-size">
        <p> To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.
            The em size unit is recommended by the W3C.1em is equal to the current font size.
            The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.
            The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em <br>
            Tips: If we use pixels, we can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px;">The text-size of this para is 30px.</p>
        <p style="font-size:1.8em;">The text-size of this para is 1.8em which is equivalent to 30px.</p>
