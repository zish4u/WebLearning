    <h3>Css Display</h3>
    <p>
      The "display" is most important css propert for controlling layout.
      The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
      Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
      The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>A block-level element</strong> always starts on a new line and takes up the full width
      available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).see the example below-
      <div> "div, h1-h6, p, form, header, footer, section" are the block level elements.This para is in div which is
      also a block level elemnt thats why its taking full width.</div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>An inline element</strong> does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.See the example below.
      <br><span>"span, a, img" are the example of inline elements.This para is in span which is
      also a inline elemnt thats why its not taking full width.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Css max-width</h3>
    <div class="one">
      <p>
        This is div1 element has width 1500px. It needs scroll to see complete div items
      </p>
    </div><br>
    <div class="two">
      <p>
        This is div2 element has mas-width 1500px.Don't require scroll, it is adjusted for screen automatically.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Note: </strong> If we resize the browser smaller than 1500px,
       browser adds a scroll for div1 because width is set as 1500px while div2 don't need scroll beacuse max-width is set as 1500px. </strong>
